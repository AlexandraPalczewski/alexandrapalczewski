			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">Designing an Isometric Infographic to Showcase Quantum Innovation</h1>
			<p>After my internship, TQT hired me to take on a large graphic design project. This project would need to visually demonstrate all the sectors where funding quantum projects would be beneficial and would help that sector grow. The project was to be presented to the federal government to demonstrate all the different uses for funding quantum innovation, and to show that funding was necessary to continue development in all of these sectors. There were many sectors to cover, such as communications, environment, manufacturing, education, and healthcare, to name only a few. TQT asked that each section be shown in relative detail so that their audience would have a clear understanding of how quantum innovation affects the real world. Furthermore, TQT wanted the graphic to be a large connected piece, rather than separate images. This project would be a difficult task; at first, I was struggling to figure out how to make the details of such a large and complex image visible and large enough to view in a printed booklet. Though the project would be presented digitally, there would also be a printed booklet handed out for viewers to take. After quite a few sketches and subsequent meetings with TQT, I came up with a solution that would meet all their criteria; the graphic would be a miniature city that would show each sector as a part of the city. This would allow all the sectors to be visibly connected together. I designed the city in an isometric style, as I thought that this would allow me to make use of the limited space in the most functional way, and would allow me to fit in a good amount of detail. The quantum city went through a number of iterations after meetings with TQT, in which features were added or deleted. At first, we found that the city was too small for all of the desired detail and more space was needed. Other details, such as roads, cars and people, also needed to be added to make the city feel more complete. After a number of iterations, the graphic was complete and made into a booklet to be sent to the federal government.</p>

			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">Lessons Learned</h1>
			<p>This was the largest graphic design project that I had ever taken on, and so I learned a lot from it. Previously, I had designed booklets, pamphlets, and infographics, however, I had never designed anything to this scale and complexity. This project pushed me and I learned new design techniques, as well as how to meet with a client productively and move forward from these meetings. I also learned that it was important to agree upon the number of iterations a design project would go through at the start of the project; this ensures that each iteration meeting will be productive, and that there is a mutually agreed upon end date to the project. This is also a very important step for a complex project such as this one, in which further detail can be added endlessly. Importantly, I learned how to both meet the demands of the client and compromise with what could be done within a given timeframe, and within the bounds of physical boundaries (such as in what format the project would be presented in).</p>
