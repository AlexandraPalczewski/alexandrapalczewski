			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">Streamlining Complex UI</h1>
			<p>ShipRush, a Seattle based software firm, helps small and midsize e-commerce companies deliver packages. It prints shipping labels and provides tracking for customers, and its technology integrates with e-commerce websites like eBay and Amazon. The ShipRush team approached our UX team to tackle a unique issue they were having with their customer shipping forms.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">Initial Issues</h1>
			<p>ShipRush's shipping forms were complex, which meant that the user flow for these forms had to be as simple as possible and follow best practices in order to minimize confusion, especially for first-time users. <b>The product owners were happy with the items on the form but found that the order they were presented in could frustrate and confuse users.</b> They wanted to streamline the client-side shipping form to minimize frustration and improve flow for their customers. <b>Specifically, they wanted to rearrange the commodity section to be more intuitive and make it easier for their users to understand the details of their package and how it would be shipped.</b> The UX lead on our team had previously worked on other sections of this form, so she was familiar with the page. <b>Together, we brainstormed ideas and then came up with low-fidelity mocks to present to the product owners.</b></p>
		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">First Designs</h1>
			<p>As this was a unique issue with specific features, there was not much need for research. <b>I got to brainstorming with the UX lead, and she helped me to understand the form and its different parts better.</b> We realized that to make the form more intuitive, the first thing we could try was moving different sections around, while also attempting to make it easier to understand which items corresponded with their package.</p>

			<div class="image-margin">
				<img src="images/cs2/1.png" class="img-fluid">
			</div>
			<div class="caption-margin">
				<p class="caption">At first, we presented a solution that was not too different from the existing shipping form. The order details, package details, and to/from sections remained as separate sections. In this mock. the UX lead had placed the feature which divided the items into specific packages in the package section, rather than in the order details.</p>
			</div>

			<p><b>One of the biggest issues we faced with the form redesign was where to place features, such as the corresponding package feature above, in a way that would be the most intuitive to users.</b> Features within the package and order details sections could often be interchanged, and so it was often difficult to decide where to place features.</p>

			<div class="image-margin">
				<img src="images/cs2/2.png" class="img-fluid">
			</div>
			<div class="caption-margin">
				<p class="caption">In this mock, the package and order details are together in one section. However, we found that doing so made the form much too confusing!</p>
			</div>

			<p>In another mock, pictured above, we actually put the package and order details together. However, we found that this could be too confusing, and there was simply too much going on in one section. We also considered adding a colored bar to separate package 1 details from package 2, and to let users know which one they were looking at (this alone attests to just how much is going on in one section!). The ShipRush team later mentioned that they wanted a minimal amount of clicks from users, so we decided that putting two sections together would not allow for this.</p>
			<p>Neither I, the UX lead, nor the ShipRush team liked the way the sections were split up in seemingly random areas across the page. They also did not want to stray too far from the original design, however, and so it was difficult to come up with a design that would meet all of the ShipRush team's criteria. Through our meetings together, it seemed that we were all at a standstill. We had arranged a few meetings with the team to explore each ideation round, and each time the designs were not what ShipRush was looking for. <b>The next time we presented a design to them, I made sure to pay a lot of attention to their comments and jot them all down.</b> Shiprush may not have known what they wanted the page to look like overall, but they did have some specific criteria. For example, they wanted the to/from section to appear first, and they also noted that users were not aware of the feature that allowed them to search for rates (and this was a key feature in their UI).</p> 
			<p><b>After the meeting and some frustrating brainstorming, I decided to try something completely different.</b> I collapsed the sections while keeping them separate and, utilizing my knowledge of composition theory, changed the way the eye moved throughout the page. Originally, there was no specific direction for the user's eye to move around the page, which certainly aided in their confusionâ€”their attention could jump back and forth between various sections, rather than flowing easily from one item to the next. I decided to streamline the page instead so that the eye would flow downward and in one direction. I also acted on ShipRush's comments in our previous meeting and made their search button more visible, and added a descriptive label so that users would be more aware of the feature that allowed them to search for competitive shipping rates between various companies. I also made note of which "assign to package" option the ShipRush team liked most in our mocks and made sure to include that within the new design. While working on this project, I discovered first hand how much of an impact active listening could have. We presented the low-fidelity mock below to the ShipRush team, and they liked this solution best.</p>

			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">Lessons Learned</h1>
			<p><b>Though this is a shorter case study, I learned some important lessons from it.</b> I learned that product owners can be unsure of what they want out of their product. This is where designers can help product owners; they can show them the page through a user's eyes, recommend best practices, and highlight some key issues that the product owners may not be aware of. I learned that <b>as much as presenting and sometimes defending ideas is important, it is also very important to listen;</b> doing so will minimize frustration for both parties, and help design the best possible product.</p>
			<p><b>Getting help was also key in this case study;</b> I would not have been able to understand such a complex UI if I had not asked for help from someone who knew it far better than I did, and who understood the intricacies of the product. This case study helped me realize how important it was to collaborate with both team members and product owners to design better solutions.</p>
