			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">Developing a Concept for a Website that Encourages Active Learning</h1>
			<p>Many of us browse social media to relax at some point in the day. <b>Though this is something that is at first enjoyable, it is inherently problematic.</b> The "short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops", as Chamath Palihapitiya, former Vice President of User Growth at Facebook calls them, in fact do anything but relax us. Ten minutes of browsing turns into half an hour, and then an hour—and over the course of the day, perhaps as much as 9 hours (Hayes).</p>
			<p>Not only does it take up a significant amount of our time, browsing social media also makes its users feel worse. Psychology Today magazine highlights a term called "relational learning" as a type of learning which we rely on to gain the most resources by ranking ourselves among others; when we see others with more, we feel negative emotions which drive us to gain more resources (Hayes). Today, we have devices in our pockets which allow us to compare ourselves socially with ease. We are now comparing ourselves to anyone, anywhere, at any time—to billionaires and successful influencers, to lifestyles that we could never live.</p>
			<p>I most obviously noticed social-media-induced negative emotions after I had come back home from a backpacking trip, where I had little network connection. After binging Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Reddit for a few days back home, I was beginning to feel like I'd eaten too much junk food; gone was the tranquil mentality I grew accustomed to while surrounded by nature. I also noticed that <b>every time I would browse social media for a few hours, at the end of the day I felt mentally sluggish and distracted.</b> And though I felt the urge to learn a slew of different topics that interested me, I instead found myself browsing social media. According to the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's research, scientists state that cognitive stimulation plays a key role in slowing Alzheimer's progression—and for those who are in early adulthood, regular cognitive challenge could reduce the risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's in their later years. <b>Learning new and challenging things not only feels good, it <i>is good for us.</i></b></p>
			<p>I told myself that I would quit social media for good—more than a handful of times. I realized that I failed to quit for an extended period of time because <b>not only is social media addictive, but it also is a time filler and a convenient way to mindlessly relax.</b></p>

			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">The Project</h1>
			<p>Psychology Today Magazine posed a question in their article "<i>The Unexpected Way New Technology Makes Us Unhappy</i>" which stated: "We're not going backwards. No one is going to smash their iPhones. What we have to do instead is create modern minds for the modern world. The question is: What does that mean and how do we do it?"</p>
			<p>I wanted to try my hand at answering this question. <b>I created Laguna with the intention of it acting as a stepping stone to form healthier habits, and to help create "modern minds for the modern world" by encouraging learning rather than browsing.</b></p>
			<p>Social media browsing didn't make me feel good, but it was hard to stop. While browsing YouTube one day, I came across the channel Lemmino which creates short 10-20 minute high-quality documentaries on topics like simulated reality, hyperspace, and psychological theory, among others. I watched a few videos and, rather than feeling how I usually did after browsing social media, I felt inspired; I wanted to learn more about theories of hyperspace, or whatever I had happened to be watching. I also realized that because I was focusing my attention on one singular topic, I was thinking more deeply about it and began asking my own questions. In short, <b>a channel such as Lemmino took me out of a state in which I was craving constant and new stimulation, and into one in which I was focused, inspired, and actively thinking.</b></p>
			<p><b>I wanted to create a platform where continuous new learning and something which I call 'deep browsing' would be more accessible.</b> I came up a concept for a website and mobile app that would allow users to learn as they browsed online.</p>
			<p>Laguna's UI aims to be minimalistic and simple, drawing attention to the content rather than the site itself. The aesthetic of the site is meant to promote a feeling similar to that of viewing art in a gallery; the gallery's job is simply to draw the viewer's attention to the art pieces. The idea of the name of the site, as well as the logo, came from something I had discovered while writing an essay. Lacuna is Latin for "a gap, void, want," but also "pond or lake". I thought of a lagoon as a sort of oasis for the mind, and the gap as my desire to have space in my mind for an undistracted, calm space for focus. The combination of these two ideas sparked the creation of Laguna.</p>

		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">Ideation and Research</h1>
			<p>I began my research by exploring any sites which attempted to answer a similar question and analyzed how they did so. I discovered the website Are.na, on which users upload "blocks" (content) into "channels" (folders of similar content). Users can also link another user's blocks to their own channel, which creates an interconnected web of content. The content seemed to vary from Tumblr- like photos to complex articles to design processes. I liked the idea of Are.na. I also researched one of my favorite YouTube channel Lemmino to probe into how the videos capture viewers so well, and what they are doing to achieve this. I recognized that Lemmino's language was casual, conversational, and accessible to all even though the topics of the videos were usually complex. They were also paired with captivating graphics which changed along with the narration. Music also played a large part although I did not implement this aspect into my project. <b>Through my research, I realized that complex topics needed to use accessible language and vivid graphics to be captivating to all users. This, paired with an easy-to-use social-media like platform, would help create a website that could make deep learning easy, accessible, and enjoyable.</b></p>
			<p>I then created many sketches to brainstorm how my app and web design would function, and tested many initial ideas against my research. I knew I wanted Laguna to function like a social media site, as this familiarity and ease of content sharing and viewing would be optimal for a website which means to act as a stepping stone for lessening social media addiction, although this seems ironic. It is not the platforms themselves which are problematic, but rather, their combination with the content they feature. <b>If this content were to be replaced with something more mentally stimulating and satisfying, perhaps it would create a powerful tool which would inspire users to be more 'mentally conscious' of the content they consume and promote deeper thought during relaxation time online.</b></p>
			<p>After brainstorming, I finalized a sketch and general layout of all the different parts of Laguna, and tweaked and finalized a first shot at the user flow. I then created a wireframe of the different pages which can be seen in the video below. I conducted user tests via a survey and five user interviews to ensure the wireframe would work smoothly and to determine any problems upfront.</p>

			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">Final Designs</h1>
			<p>I then created a detailed layout of how the site would function. Firstly, the home page includes a brief 'about' section which highlights Laguna's vision and purpose in a conversational tone, followed by a "how it works" section which details how the site functions. <b>This was something that frustrated me after exploring Are.na, since I had to find out how features worked on my own as there was no section explaining them;</b> furthermore, the user flow on Are.na was not intuitive and took some trial and error. This section would be followed by one which would list a few chosen user reviews. Finally, the last section is meant to give users a taste of what kind of content they might find on Laguna were they to create an account.</p>

			<div class="caption-margin">
				<p class="caption">A high fidelity mock shows the Laguna home page prior to sign up. The page gives potential users a taste of some of the articles they can view. Clicking the "How it Works" section leads to a page which guides users through basic functions of the site, which is something that Are.na was badly in need of.</p>
			</div>

			<p><b>The 'discover' page functions similarly to a social media feed, as it shows content or articles scattered abut the page.</b> The user can search for various topics in the search bar, and are able to sort through content via options such as "following", "new", "featured", and "trending". They can also search for articles via their different tags. Each article or post which is posted would prompt the publisher to create a minimum of three topic tags. These tags make it easier to find related posts if a user is looking for a specific topic that may not be evident in the title.</p>

			</div>

			<p>The profile page is split into two sections: "saved" and "created". The user can search through either of these sections using tags or keywords to make it easier to find a particular post. <b>I noticed that it was impossible to find blocks on Are.na unless you manually searched for them through their associated channel. I wanted to implement a more user-friendly feature, so I created the addition of a search bar within the user's saved and created posts so that posts are easier to find, even if they are unorganized.</b> The user also has the option to organize their saved and created files by creating folders for them.</p>

			<h1 class="header-text header-margin">Lessons Learned</h1>
			<p>Laguna was among one of my first UX projects and attempts at an entire mobile app and web design. In this project I mostly dealt with research, ideation, and design, with a little bit of testing. If I were to return to this project today, I would need to add more iterations in which I would test the current design and entire user flow against a larger group of users (my previous testing involved a handful of my friends) via different methods. In each iteration I would focus on a particular design aspect of the site or app, and I expect that the project would only fully be ready after many more months of iterating!</p>
			<p><b>One of the most important things I learned through completing this project is that a seemingly simple idea still takes a whole lot of consideration, planning, tinkering with and testing.</b> I learned that good user testing done throughout iterations of the project is incredibly helpful in detecting issues early on and in seeing the project from new angles. I also learned to keenly discern why I was unsatisfied with a site or application as a user, and how to take this dissatisfaction and try to make something out of it.</p>
			<p>I also learned how to implement my intended mission statement throughout the site, which was to promote learning rather than browsing. For example, I purposefully avoided showing the number of saves that a post would have to users; this would avoid the issue that I recognized when using Instagram. I realized that I was far more ready to "like" a post when it already had a lot of likes, versus a post which had much fewer, merely because of its popularity. I also tested this option in a user survey within a small group and found that most other users had the same habit as I did. By choosing not to show the amount of likes a post has, I hoped to entice users to discover and learn about topics they might originally not have.</p>
